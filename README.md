# RAGExample
a little RAG's experiment wanna see how good i can make my own local llm's perform with good RAG and various other things

- [ ] pick a model from [embedding leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) [KaLM is good as of nov 20th 2025](https://huggingface.co/tencent/KaLM-Embedding-Gemma3-12B-2511)
- [ ] download docs [python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/download.html), [mdn](https://kapeli.com/mdn_offline), [react](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev) [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/tree/master/src/doc/src) [rustc docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/main/src/doc/rustc) and for actual rust stuff grab the rust docs via `rustup component add rust-docs`
- [ ] setup a rag system using python + flask
- [ ] pick a [text generation model](https://huggingface.co/tasks/text-generation) choose something like instruct probably maybe try and find a leader board for it
- [ ] host & run model + build a ui for it
